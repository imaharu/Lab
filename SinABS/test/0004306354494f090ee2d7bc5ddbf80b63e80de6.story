-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- thousands on saturday fled the area in southwestern ivory coast where attacks left seven u.n. peacekeepers and eight civilians dead , according to a u.n. official .

one attack occurred late thursday and into friday near para village , not far from the west-central african nation 's border with liberia , according to the united nations .

humanitarian organizations reported saturday they were expecting about 4,000 people in tai , said remi dourlot , a spokesman for the u.n. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs . several hundred had arrived by midday saturday in the town , which is on the edge of tai national park .

another 35 families crossed the ivory coast 's southwest border into u.n. refugee camps in liberia , and humanitarian groups said hundreds of others had been pushed south by the violence , according to dourlot .

the movement comes after blue-helmeted peacekeepers -- who were in the area because of threats against civilians -- came under attack , the united nations said in a statement .

besides the u.n. peacekeepers , humanitarian groups reported eight civilians died in violence , said dourlot .

u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon on friday called on the government of ivory coast `` to do its utmost to identify the perpetrators and hold them accountable . '' he added that he understood other peacekeepers remained in danger .

`` even tonight , after the attack , more than 40 peacekeepers remain with the villagers in this remote region to protect them from this armed group , '' ban said .

u.n. operation in cote d'ivoire and ivory coast troops have increased their presence in the area , dourlot said saturday . members of the u.n. humanitarian affairs office have deployed to tai to coordinate relief efforts there with local authorities .

a spokeswoman for the u.n. mission in ivory coast said friday 's incident was the first attack on peacekeepers since they entered the country in 2004 .

sylvie van den wildenberg , in a telephone interview from her office in abidjan , said the remaining forces were continuing to protect area residents , `` who are living in a very difficult terrain -- their villages scattered . ''

van den wildenberg said it was not clear who was responsible for the attack , which occurred mid-afternoon . `` this is an area where you have so many different types of armed people , '' she said . `` people have different aims and different reasons to carry arms and to perpetrate attack . so this is a very complex environment . we ca n't extrapolate . we just ca n't fingerpoint any group . ''

the peacekeepers were on a reconnaissance patrol because u.n. officials had heard rumors several days earlier of armed men in the area threatening to attack a village , she said .

u.n. peacekeepers remained in ivory coast after the 2010 presidential election , when the country was thrown into crisis after incumbent president laurent gbagbo refused to acknowledge defeat to former prime minister alassane ouattara . the latter was sworn in on may 21 . gbagbo is in custody at the hague , accused of crimes against humanity during post-election violence that killed thousands .

according to the united nations , its peacekeeping force in ivory coast as of april 30 included nearly 11,000 uniformed personnel , as well as several hundred international civilian personnel , local staff and volunteers . they provide technical , logistical and security support to the government .

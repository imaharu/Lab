the virus inspection and immunoserologic inspection of balf and blood plasma were carried out for 14 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( <unk> ) patients and of 8 patients hospitalized for <unk> acute <unk> .
in the blood plasma , il-6 , il-7 , il-8 and il-10 significantly increased in the acute <unk> stage compared with the stable stage .
the basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic <unk> inflammation .
in <unk> inflammation , various cells such as eosinophils , t-cells , <unk> cells , <unk> , macrophages and <unk> epithelium , and various liquid factors are involved .
it is taken <unk> that th2 cytokine is involved not only in central <unk> , but also in peripheral <unk> , in the position of <unk> inflammation .
for the treatment of asthma , it is important to introduce antiinflammatory drugs , mainly inhalation steroids , from the early stage , for the suppression of the <unk> of <unk> in addition to the control of allergic inflammation .
in addition , objective evaluation of air flow restriction by a respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of asthma .
it is evaluated by spirometry or peak flow meter , and <unk> <unk> test is performed .
the evaluation of <unk> inflammation is performed by <unk> test , measurement of nitrogen monoxide concentration in the <unk> , <unk> condensate measurement , and allergological examination .
the diseases which cause stridor and <unk> , such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , insufficiency of left heart and hyperventilation syndrome are the object of the differentiation .
as a result of our genetic analysis , the possibility that il-17f gene <unk> an important role in the disease state of asthma is guessed .
ccl5 is a chemokine induced strongly from <unk> epithelium in viral infection , and especially , it may <unk> an important role for the acquisition of chronic <unk> inflammation in high-age asthma .
when the attention was paid to the role of macrophage inhibitory factor , it was guessed that natural immune system is deeply involved in the disease state of allergy .
from the above , the understanding of the disease was <unk> by clarifying the <unk> common <unk> at the molecular level .
by making these pathways to be a target , it is expected to contribute to the advance in the prevention and treatment of asthma .
we outlined the electrocardiogram synchronous <unk> ct <unk> ( 4 d-cta ) developed in order to understand the dynamic status of cerebral aneurysm wall <unk> .
we are able to obtain the objective cerebral aneurysm images using 4d-cta s-mpr .
moreover , we described the problem and practice of 4d-cta images .
blood collection is indispensable for glucose level measurement for the diabetes mellitus diagnosis at present .

in the <unk> wave region , possibility of the in vivo measurement of the glucose level by measuring the resonance characteristic using the patch antenna excited by the waveguide was examined .
by the difference of the <unk> phase image , it was confirmed that the temperature distribution measurement could be realized .
this system can be utilized in various medical systems as non-invasive temperature monitor of the intraorganism .
the features of clinical images and molecular-genetical features of the enhanced s-cone syndrome ( escs ) were outlined including the cases .
the cause gene is the nr2e3 gene .
as the cases , the following were taken up : a patient of 17-year-old man with <unk> who had the mutation in the <unk> and a patient of 33-year-old woman of the <unk> case observing from the side of visual function maintenance .
the case was a 47-year-old woman , who complained <unk> hypogastrium fullness feeling .
the <unk> leio myoma was suspected the most by various examinations such as a <unk> <unk> mri , and the malignant tumor could not be denied in the preoperative diagnosis , and then , both <unk> panhysterectomy and sides adnexectomy method in gynaecologia were carried out .
it was diagnosed pathohistologically as a metastatic <unk> cancer , and as a result of the primary lesion scanning , it was proven as the bilateral breast cancer .
the following were carried out after the preoperative systemic chemotherapy : left <unk> muscle preservation ablatio <unk> , left axillary lymph node purification , right <unk> partial excision .
the postoperative irradiation was carried out on 3 places of left parapet , right preserved mammary gland and right armpit .
the re-rise of a tumor marker was recognized in postoperative 16th month , and the progress of the symptom could not be stopped , and the case died of the carcinomatous peritonitis .
ricin , botulinal toxin , and <unk> cytotoxin are fatally <unk> protein <unk> which are <unk> to be used for a biochemical <unk> or bioterrorism .
national research institute of police science , school of engineering of nagoya university , and <unk> <unk> university have jointly developed an accurate rapid detection method for those <unk> .
the principle of detection is based on the usage of <unk> chains and surface plasmon resonance ( <unk> ) .
this new method requires a far shorter measuring time than the conventional methods , and has high reliability and good manipulability .
a case ( 16-year-old woman ) of linear <unk> with spinal <unk> is reported .
erythema with linear arrangement from the right <unk> to the <unk> appeared .
from clinical laboratory findings , <unk> findings and image examination findings , linear <unk> with spinal <unk> was diagnosed .
by the mometasone furancarboxylate ointment , the <unk> was improved a little , and the <unk> derived from the normal skin was continued .
that it becomes an antagonist of the interferon with other viral protein and that it exists in cell nucleus in the later stage of the infection locally are reported west <unk> virus ( wnv ) ns4 b protein .
in this study , the <unk> of ns4 b protein to the nucleus was analyzed , and the biological significance was examined .
it was observed that ns4 b protein existed even in not only viral infection cell but also noninfected cell as a fusion protein which added the red fluorochrome in the nucleus locally .
in the nuclear translocation of ns4 b protein , that c-terminal of 50 amino acid of this protein was important changed clear the analysis of <unk> <unk> .
and , it was indicated to be concerned in the control of the cell division , because many ns4 b protein existed in the dividing cell nucleus locally .
in <unk> carcinoma , lymph node metastasis and remote metastasis are less than <unk> bile duct cancer which is the equal primary hepatic cancer .
however , the treatment becomes difficult , since mass is often formed in the multiple .
that simultaneously , multiple mass formation arise with the liver lesion as a background in many places is clarifying .
it is necessary to always have the multicenter carcinogenesis in mind on case of liver-cell carcinoma with hepatitis and liver cirrhosis , etc. in the background .
in this paper , the following were explained : until now knowledge on the multicenter carcinogenesis and practical method of identification of the multicenter generation .
the liver is the organ in which the <unk> blood flow from the digestive system organ flows first , and it is the organ in which metastasis frequency of the digestive cancer is the highest .
in this paper , large bowel cancer was outlined center on each therapy for metastatic liver cancer .

for a case of which over 10 years passed after <unk> and which the adverse reactions were conspicious by <unk> administration of anti ‐ p ingredients based on levodopa ( i ) , combination therapy with low protein diet of each 6g at <unk> and <unk> was conducted .
results showed stabilization of nervous symptoms and reduction of adverse reactions .
this effecacy was maintained during 2 years and no nutritional disturbance was shown , suggesting that combination of this treatment shows long ‐ term usefulness of p <unk> .
single neural discharge of the cutaneous pain receptor ( r ) of <unk> rats was recorded to examine the effects of chinoform ( c ) on thermal reaction .
no obvious change in r was observed with thermal reaction in the control group to which a dimethyl sulfoxide solution <unk> was administered .
in the c ‐ administered group , thermal reaction clearly increased the activity of r for 240 minutes .
behavioral <unk> by c suggests possible increase in r activity .
<unk> smon patients were treated by acupuncture and moxibustion ( 9.9 months and 32.3 months in averate ) and were observed to <unk> the transition of their abnormal sense and <unk> complaint .
although the level and the <unk> of abnormal sense remained the same , 5 % or more were relieved in their &quot; smart feeling &quot; and &quot; pain . &quot; regarding
the <unk> complaint , 10 % or more were relieved in their diarrhoea , anorexia , <unk> disorder and headache .
immediately after the surgery , there were cases who <unk> &quot; lightened body , &quot; &quot; relieved cramp &quot; and &quot; <unk> of the leg . &quot;
integrated research reports of 1994 were made on the above issue ( 19 papers ) .
the research was prepared by focusing on the mechanism of <unk> <unk> necrosis and its prevention .
the research clinically aimed to understand the cerebral circulation failure development mechanism for the <unk> to <unk> stage , and to develop learly diagnosis and treatment methods .
following the previous period , a <unk> joint study on pregnant women , <unk> , and newborn infants is also under way .
on the <unk> of the survival time analysis with regard to manifestation of and progress in <unk> <unk> , studies were carried out on a statistical analysis method to analyze data including those on the <unk> ( left side <unk> ) of cases in which the events occurred already .
as a result , it is verified that there occurs high bias in estimation of the survival time in the usual analysis in which the left side <unk> is not taken into consideration .
and , it is shown that there occurs a bias in some cases when the <unk> distribution is applied to the survival time by the <unk> maximum <unk> method .
it is thought to be effective as the approach to estimate the basic survival function by the <unk> ‐ <unk> method after correction of the influence of risk factors by the <unk> method .
